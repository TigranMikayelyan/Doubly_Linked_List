<i> <br> 
A doubly linked list is a data structure used in computer science and programming for organizing and storing
a collection of elements or nodes. 
It is an extension of the more basic singly linked list and offers additional flexibility and functionality
</i>

<hr>
<br>
In a doubly linked list, each node contains two pointers or references, one pointing to the next node 
in the sequence (often called the "next" or "forward" pointer), 
and another pointing to the previous node in the sequence (often called the "prev" or "backward" pointer). 
These two pointers make it possible to traverse the list in both directions, from the head (the first node) 
to the tail (the last node) and vice versa.
